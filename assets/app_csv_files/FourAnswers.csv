Dopamine is the pleasure hormone that also has functionalities in controlling smooth movement and decreasing rigidity in the body (deficiency leads to tremors as seen in Parkinson's). Serotonin is involved in the mood and arousal of the body, as well as certain portions of the  REM sleep cycle. GABA and glycine are both inhibitory neurotransmitters that are involved in hyperpolarization of the cell and cause an inhibiton effect within the brain.

Organic Chemistry,SN1 reactions in organic chemistry are a type of substitution reaction. How many steps does it take?,1,2,3,4,2,"In organic chemistry, the first two substitution reactions that you learn about are the SN1 and SN2 reactions. The SN1 reaction is based on a two-step process that utilizes the leaving group as its first step and then the attack of the nucleophile as its second. It will replace the original leaving group on the substrate with a new nucleophile. It is favored by polar protic solvents (such as water or ethanol), its reaction rate is only dependent upon the leaving group/substrate, it yields a racemic mixture (enantiomers of one another) and a strong nucleophile is not required. the SN2 reaction has the same outcome: the nucleophile replaces the leaving group on the substrate. However, the main difference is that this occurs in a concerted mechanism, or in one step.SN2 reactions favor methyl substrates, favor polar aprotic solvents, are optically active (resulting in an inversion of configuration), and are favored with a stronger nucleophile (something with a negative charge).",,Substitution and Elimination,,A2071

Behavioral Science,Which of the following is considered a monocular cue?,Relative size,Interposition,Relative height,All of the above,4,"There are visual cues in which humans do not require the use of both eyes and only one. These are known as the monocular cues (relative size, interposition, relative height, shading, motion parallax, constancy cues). Relative size is that, the closer an object is, the larger it is perceived to be. Interposition is when one object is in front of another and that the object in the front is closer. Relative height is when things that are higher are perceived to be further away than those that are lower. Shading is used when there are light and shadows that allow the person to detect the depth behinds certain things. Motion parallax gives the relative motion of certain objects and things that are further away appear to be slower rather than things that are closer. Constancy is that our perception of a particular object is not altered even if the image is different that the retina sees and this can be divided into size constancy, shape constancy, and color constancy. Size constancy is that because something is closer, it appears larger but we still think it is the same size. Shape constancy is when there is a changing shape but we still perceive it as the same shape (opening a window- it is still a rectangle despite its shape being altered). Color constancy is when, despite the changes in lighting that can occur, we understand the object is still the same color it was before those changes (shining a light on something to make it appear brighter).",No,Sensation/Perception,,A2319

Pragnanz is when we take a complicated structure and then reduce it to its simplest form (think of the Olympic rings). Proximity is when we group objects that are close to one another. Continuity is when we look at lines and trace the simplest path that they could follow. Closure is when we fill the object in or when we have grouped objects together and see the ""whole"" picture. Symmetry is when the mind looks at an object and is able to cut the object in half through a focal point (think of a meso compound).
