Physics,Velocity tends to remain constant according to Newton's First Law.,TRUE,FALSE,1,"Newton has three different laws to help describe the Newtonian forces. The First Law, also known as the inertia law, states that velocity tends to remain constant. This means that an object in motion tends to stay in motion (typically in a straight line) and an object that is at rest tends to stay at rest. Velocity can only change when there is an applied net force on the object. The other important thing to note is that mass is a measure of the object's resistance to acceleration, otherwise known as inertia. Newton's Second Law is essentially the force is equivalent to a mass multipled by an acceleration. An applied net force can cause movement in an object and generally force and acceleration point in the same direction. If the force is equivalent to zero, then the acceleration is equivalent to zero and vice versa (which also means the velocity is constant or zero). Be careful! The MCAT will often try and trick people by saying all or none statements such as ""the velocity is constant"" or ""the velocity is zero"".

The First Law, also known as the inertia law, states that velocity tends to remain constant. This means that an object in motion tends to stay in motion (typically in a straight line) and an object that is at rest tends to stay at rest. Velocity can only change when there is an applied net force on the object. The other important thing to note is that mass is a measure of the object's resistance to acceleration, otherwise known as inertia. Newton's Second Law is essentially the force is equivalent to a mass multipled by an acceleration. An applied net force can cause movement in an object and generally force and acceleration point in the same direction. If the force is equivalent to zero, then the acceleration is equivalent to zero and vice versa (which also means the velocity is constant or zero). Be careful! The MCAT will often try and trick people by saying all or none statements such as ""the velocity is constant"" or ""the velocity is zero"". Zero acceleration/force means it can be either one: constant velocity or zero velocity. The Third Law is that an action has an equal and opposite reaction (IMPORTANT: this does NOT mean there is an equal effect). ",No,Kinematics and Newtonian Forces,,B2826

Relative height is when things that are higher are perceived to be further away than those that are lower. Shading is used when there are light and shadows that allow the person to detect the depth behinds certain things. Motion parallax gives the relative motion of certain objects and things that are further away appear to be slower rather than things that are closer. Constancy is that our perception of a particular object is not altered even if the image is different that the retina sees and this can be divided into size constancy, shape constancy, and color constancy. Size constancy is that because something is closer, it appears larger but we still think it is the same size. Shape constancy is when there is a changing shape but we still perceive it as the same shape (opening a window- it is still a rectangle despite its shape being altered). Color constancy is when, despite the changes in lighting that can occur, we understand the object is still the same color it was before those changes (shining a light on something to make it appear brighter).",No,Sensation/Perception,,B2881
Behavioral Science,Hearing adaptation involves the inner ear muscle.,TRUE,FALSE,1,"Hearing adaptation is involved in dampening the vibrations to help protect the tympanic membrane.

Biology,Estrogen levels are high during the proliferative phase.,TRUE,FALSE,1,"In the uterine cycle, there are three phases that you need to be familiar with. The first is the menstruation phase, which lasts from day 1-5 and is characterized by the shedding of the old endometrium. During this time, the estrogen and progesterone levels are both low. The proliferative phase, which lasts from day 6-14, is involved in the rebuilding of the endometrium. Estrogen levels are high and the progesterone levels are low (estrogen establishes the endometrium). The secretory phase (days 15-28) is when the endometrium is enhanced through the influx of progesterone. During this time, the estrogen levels are stabilized and the progesterone levels are high (you can remember this as progesterone protects the endometrium through its enhancement).",No,Reproduction and Development,,B3094
